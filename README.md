# Portfolio-Page
 
This is the repository of my portfolio page. As a developer in favor of open source community. I thought that people should be able to check out the code and help me improve! So, I have decided to use React for my portfolio as this is the framework I feel most confident and enjoy my time while creating applications with. At the beginning I had several ideas about the design. The pages were clear, I only wanted to have four pages but to design them took my time. Along the way I changed the styles 2-3 times, starting from scratch each time. 

Basically, whole portfolio consists of four pages. On the landing page, user will be greeted with a animated funny text which describes myself too. There is a high possibility that you are also coming from there as redirect user to here to check source code of my site. On about page you can have some some more information about me along with the tech-stack I have. If you spend enough time there, you will notice that I display a message about me contributing to React community which I'm really proud of. 

On portfolio page, you can see my projects, scroll through them and check the code or live versions. I displayed them as cards with buttons on them to make it easier for users to reach out to code or live versions even before clicking the card. Once user clicks on the card, modal window will open with the details of projects. On top corners there is buttons to go back and forth and check the other projects. Below you will see the buttons with repository and live version links. 

At last, contact page has less information. Precisely my mail address and the social media links. 

## Challenges

As I said before I had to start from scratch to change styles of my website which I find challenging. Because its always hard to leave your comfort zone and once you have something working its even harder. But I didn't hesitate to leave that zone and improved myself. Honestly saying, I learnt a lot on this journey. Discovered lots of cool libraries and ways to implement them. 

At the moment, I'm satisfied with my work but probably this will not last long. I'm sure that I'll be playing with this project a lot to implement new stuff I learn everyday. If you see anything to be improved please feel free to create issues so I can improve that specific thing.
